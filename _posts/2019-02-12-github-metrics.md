<center><b>Github Metrics</b> is a simple, one dashboard per organization/repository data visualization</center>

I made this webapp mainly to see who were the main contributors to my open source organizations and to reward those that went a step beyond. If like this project or is using it, please give a **star** for motivation, it values my work.
